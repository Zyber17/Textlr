# Textlr

Rising from the ashes, Textlr is a now Node-based [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) uploading service. There are a lot of cool things in store for Textlr if I can find the time to code them.

Also, I'm going to try to code this entire project in Vim, so help me Luna.
