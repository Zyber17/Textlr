  "readme": "# Snockets\n\nA JavaScript/CoffeeScript concatenation tool for Node.js inspired by [Sprockets](https://github.com/sstephenson/sprockets). Used by [connect-assets](http://github.com/TrevorBurnham/connect-assets) to create a Rails 3.1-style asset pipeline.\n\nWritten in CoffeeScript by the author of [CoffeeScript: Accelerated JavaScript Development](http://pragprog.com/book/tbcoffee/coffeescript).\n\n## Usage (script-side)\n\nIn your CoffeeScript files, write Sprockets-style comments to indicate dependencies, e.g.\n\n    #= require dependency\n\n(or `//= require dependency` in JavaScript). If you want to bring in a whole folder of scripts, use\n\n    #= require_tree dir\n\n## Usage (Node-side)\n\nFirst,\n\n    npm install snockets\n\nThen in your app:\n\n    Snockets = require 'snockets'\n    snockets = new Snockets()\n\nEach `Snockets` instance has a `depGraph` property, an instance of [dep-graph](https://github.com/TrevorBurnham/dep-graph). You can `scan` a file to just update the dependency graph:\n\n    snockets.scan 'dir/foo.coffee', (err, depGraph) -> ...\n\nTo get a list of filenames showing the series of dependencies the scanned file has, you'd use `depGraph.getChain 'dir/foo.coffee'`.\n\nYou can get a list of compiled JavaScripts corresponding to the dependency chain (starting from the first required file to the requested file) using `getCompiledChain`:\n\n    snockets.getCompiledChain 'dir/foo.coffee', (err, jsList) -> ...\n\nThe result is in the format `[{filename: \"dependency1.js\", js: \"// code\"}, ...]`. Note that those JavaScript files are not actually created by `getCompiledChain`.\n\nSnockets can also provide a single compiled, concatenated file (optionally run through [UglifyJS](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS) if the `minify` option is passed in):\n\n    snockets.getConcatenation 'dir/foo.coffee', minify: true, (err, js) -> ...\n\nNote that you don't need to `scan` before or after running `getCompiledChain` or `getConcatenation`; they update the dependency graph the same way that `scan` does.\n\n## Synchronous mode\n\nBy default, Snockets uses only async file methods. You can pass the option `async: false` to either of its methods if you want it to be synchronous instead. In synchronous mode, you can use either callbacks or return values, e.g.\n\n    js = snockets.getConcatenation 'dir/foo.coffee', async: false\n\n## License\n\nÂ©2011 Trevor Burnham and available under the [MIT license](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php):\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
