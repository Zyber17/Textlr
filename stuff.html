				<h1>Have Some Help.</h1>
				<h2>Textlr has a lot of cool features that you probably didn't know about. Here's how to use them.</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<h3>Markdown</h3>
						<p>All your documents will be parsed through <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Title Your Work</h3>
						<p>If you're a markdown user, you know that a line starting with <code>#</code> will become a first-level heading. If the first line of your document is a first level heading we automatically use it as title of your document. It's a as simple as that.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<h3>I don't want a title!</h3>
								<p>Don't want your work to be titled but want your document to being with a first level heading? No worries, Just make the top line of your document empty.</p>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Preview</h3>
						<p>Want to preview your document? Just press and hold ⌘⌥ (cmd+alt) on a Mac. Theoretically it'd be Windows Key+Alt on a PC but that's never been tested.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>I wish I didn't have to move my mouse so far to click that "Upload" button.</h3>
						<p>You don't! Just press ⌘Enter (cmd+enter) when you want to submit on a Mac. Theoretically it'd be Windows Key+Enter on a PC but that's never been tested.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
