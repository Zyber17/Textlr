Textlr is a project by Zackary Corbett
It is a simple text uploading database, it uses mrkdown, and has a semi-live preview.
It is my first attempt to use classes

Additionally, there's no install function, but it's pretty simple.
Just go to phpmyadmin, make a new database, make a tabe in it called "uploads" (no quotes), and enter 3 feilds: id (int, primary, auto_inctoment), test (long text), and short_url (varchar(5)).
Then just go to stuff.php and inter your DB credentials. 

That's it. I might add and an install someday. Enjoy
