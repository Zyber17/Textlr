Textlr is a project by Zackary Corbett
It is a simple text uploading database, it uses markdown, and has a semi-live preview.
It is my first attempt to use classes

Additionally, there's no install function, but it's pretty simple.
Just go to phpmyadmin, make a new database, make a table in it called "uploads" (no quotes), and enter 3 feilds: id (int, primary, auto_incriment), text (long text), and short_url (varchar(5)).
Then just go to stuff.php and inter your DB credentials.  (Sorry, for now you'll have to do it all manually in all 3 spots, MAMP is freaking out so I can't add a DB array to save everyone the trouble and time of switching everything).

That's it. I might add and an install someday. Enjoy.

//Okay, MAMP is freaking out on me. I think this should work, please let me know if it doesn't.
