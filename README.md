# Simple Text Uploading

Textlr is a open source platform for uploaded text for easy sharing. It uses [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and has other nifty features baked in. The official Textlr web service is available to use at [textlr.org](http://textlr.org/), but anyone is free to host it.
