# Simple Text Uploading

Textlr is a open source platform for uploaded text for easy sharing. It uses [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and has other nifty features baked in. The official Textlr web service is available to use at [textlr.org](http://textlr.org/), but anyone is free to host it.

## Roadmap

1. Deal with errors that occur over AJAX better.

## Installation

Installing it is rather easy. Just change the credentials in `db.php` to your credentials and you're pretty much done. A few things might be hard coded to point to textlr.org, but that's easily changeable.
