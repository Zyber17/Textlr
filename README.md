Textlr is a project by Zackary Corbett
It's a simple text uploading service, it uses [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), and has other nifty features that get out of your way when writing.

Should someone want help installing it on h(is|er) own server, Zackary Corbett can be reached at <hello@zyber17.com>.
