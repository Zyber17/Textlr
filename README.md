Textlr is a simple text uploading service. It uses [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) to style the uploaded text, and has other nifty features that get out of your way when writing (like `!commands`). Textlr is available to use at [textlr.org](http://textlr.org/)

Installing it is pretty easy. In fact, anyone who knows what GitHub is has a pretty good shot of setting it up on a server just by reading the source code. Still, should anyone want help setting it up, email me at <hello@zyber17.com> and Iâ€™ll be glad to help if I can.
