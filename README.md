# Simple Text Uploading

Textlr is a open source platform for uploaded text for easy sharing. It uses [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and has other nifty features baked in. The official Textlr web service is available to use at [textlr.org](http://textlr.org/), but anyone is free to host it.

Current version: `2.0`.

## Roadmap

`@v:x.x.x` is a tag to describe the version of Textlr that the roadmap items are slated for

1. Style dialogue boxes more proactively. @v:2.1
2. Improve handling of special characters in descriptive URLs. @v:2.1
3. Improve styling of titles on mobile devices. @v:2.1
4. Clean up the code (Especially the JavaScript). @v:2.1

## Installation

Installing it is rather easy. Just change the credentials in `db.php` to your credentials and you're pretty much done. A few things might be hard coded to point to textlr.org, but that's easily changeable.
